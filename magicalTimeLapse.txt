All
of

it

as
a

as

always
we
were
interested
in
discovering
just
how
the
doomed
man
chose
to

his

of

free
men
who
have
a
choice
not
condemned
criminals
whose
sphere
of
activities
is
strictly
delimited
Such
stories
set
us
thinking
wondering
what
we
should
do
under
similar
circumstances
What
events
what
experiences
what
associations
should
we
crowd
into
those
last
hours
as
mortal
beings
What
happiness
