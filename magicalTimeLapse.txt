All
of
us
have
read
thrilling
stories
in
which
the
hero
had
only
a
limited
and
specified
time
to
live
Sometimes
it
was
as
long
as
a
year
sometimes
as
short
as
twentyfour
hours
But
always
we
were
interested
in
discovering
just
how
the
doomed
man
chose
to
spend
his
last
days
or
his
last
hours

speak
of
course
of
free
men
who
have
a
choice
not
condemned
criminals
whose
sphere
of
activities
is
strictly
delimited
Such
stories
set
us
thinking

what
we
should
do
under
similar
circumstances
What
events
what
experiences
what
associations
should
we
crowd
into
those
last
hours
as
mortal
beings
What
happiness
should
